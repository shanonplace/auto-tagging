# Overview
 This is a simple POC to show how multiple content types could be have a tag created and applied automatically whenever those types are created, utilizing webhooks and the Contentful Content Management API and JavaScript SDK

# Creation
 I created this little example by running the following commands to generate the boiler plate code
 
 `npx express-generator --no-view --git auto-tagging`

 `cd auto-tagging && npm install`

# Installation

`npm install`

# Run
`npm start`

### Note: I know the code shouldn't be putting everthing in the controller, this was just for educational purposes :)
